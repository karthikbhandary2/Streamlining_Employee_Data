# Streamlining_Employee_Data
Wouldn't it be great if your data was stored in your favorite format, ready to be analyzed? Unfortunately, that's rarely the case. Data comes in different formats, and being able to merge these different sources in a single file for analysis is a fundamental skill for any data practitioner.  In this project, I imported employee and human resources data in CSV, Excel, and JSON format. I then merged it all into a single DataFrame, before cleaning it and exporting the results into a single CSV file.
